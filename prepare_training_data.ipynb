decisions.\\n\"Let It Be\" was written mainly by McCartney and was based on a riff he had developed while playing guitar in a pub in Liverpool.\\nThe song underwent numerous rewrites before Martin was satisfied with its final form.\\n\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" was originally written as a slow ballad, but Lennon reworked it into a faster-paced number after being inspired\\n\\nA kinglet or crest is a small bird of the family Tyrannidae.\\nThey are typically very small, with short bills and stubby legs.\\nThey inhabit open habitats, such as grasslands and shrublands, and are often seen in flocks.\\nKinglets are one of the most common bird families in the world, with around 150 species in 15 genera.\\nThey vary in size from the pygmy kinglet, at just 9 mm, to the great horned owl, at 1.5 m long.\\nThe majority of kinglets are small, with a length of 25–35 cm and a weight of 10–20 g. They have short, thick bills and strong legs.\\nThey are typically grey or brown in colour, with a white or buff crown or band on their head.\\nThey have long tails which they use to balance as they walk. \\nThe kinglet family is found across much of the Northern Hemisphere, from North America to Europe and Asia.\\nThey are mainly found in open habitats, such as grasslands and shrublands, but some species can be found in forests.\\nKinglets are usually active during the morning and evening, but some species can be active at any time of day. \\nKinglets feed on insects, which they catch by catching them in their bill or by perching on a twig and pecking at insects that come near.\\nKinglets are usually solitary birds, but some species form flocks during migration.\\n<edit> The long feathers forming the central crown stripe can be erected; they are inconspicuous most of the time, but are used in courtship and territorial displays when the raised crest is very striking. </edit>\\n\\nV Graham Norton is a British chat show host, comedian and television personality.\\nHe is best known for his work on the BBC show \"The Graham Norton Show\" and for his regular appearances on the British television series \"The Friday Night Project\".\\nNorton was born in Hammersmith, London, to Irish parents, and was brought up in Dublin.\\nHe began his career as a stand-up comedian in the early 1990s.\\nHe first came to prominence in 1996, when he won the prestigious Perrier Award for Best Newcomer.\\nIn 2000, he moved to the United Kingdom and began hosting \"The Graham Norton Show\", a BBC2 chat show which ran for six series.\\nThe show became popular in the United States when it was aired on Comedy Central from 2005 to 2007.\\nFrom 2007 to 2009, Norton co-hosted \"The Paul O\\'Grady Show\" on ITV with O\\'Grady.\\n<edit> It aired from 6 May 2002 to 28 December 2003. </edit>\\nThe show has been nominated for several awards, including two BAFTAs (2006 and 2007) and a Golden Globe (2007).\\nIn February 2013, it was announced that Norton would be joining forces with American talk show host Conan O\\'Brien on a new project called \"Conan\", which aired its first episode in April 2013.\\nIn December 2014, it was announced that Norton would be leaving \"The Graham Norton Show\" after its tenth series.\\nIn addition to his work as a television presenter\\n\\nRitual landscapes are extensive archaeological tracts that have been identified as having been used for religious purposes by a specific culture or groups of people.\\nThey often contain areas that have been specifically selected and modified for their ritual importance, as well as areas that have been more generally used.\\nRitual landscapes are associated with a number of different religious traditions, including those of ancient Europe, the Americas, and Asia.\\nThey are also common among certain Native American cultures.\\nRitual landscapes may be found in locations that are sacred to one or more religions, or they may be located in locations that have special meaning to a particular community.\\nThe creation of a ritual landscape can involve a number of different activities.\\nTypically, it will involve the modification of natural features in order to create areas that are specificially suited for religious purposes.\\nThis may include the installation of altars, shrines, or other religious structures.\\nIt may also involve the use of symbolism to represent important aspects of religious belief.\\nRitual landscapes can be quite extensive in terms of their overall size.\\nThey may cover an area that is several hundred square kilometers, or they may be much smaller – typically covering only a few dozen hectares.\\n<edit> This is demonstrated in the case of Tibet, the verticality of the environment dominated the constructions of the ritual landscape and features therein such as structures and tombs, which were built to resemble the mountains. </edit>\\nHowever, this is not always possible, and sometimes ritual landscapes remain undiscovered for centuries.\\n\\nChristopher Stewart (born 27 March 1951) is an Australian author.\\nHe has written several books for young adults, including the best-selling novel The Catcher in the Rye.\\n<edit> When not writing, he runs a farm, where he lives, near Orgiva in Spain. </edit>\\nStewart was born in Sydney, Australia, to a theatrical family.\\nHis mother, Muriel (née Murphy), was an actress and his father, John Stewart, was a stage manager and producer.\\nHe has two sisters.\\nStewart\\'s early education was at Sydney Grammar School, where he was captain of the cricket team and editor of the school magazine.\\nHe then attended the University of Sydney, where he studied English literature.\\nIn 1975, Stewart moved to Melbourne to work as a creative writing teacher at Deakin University.\\n<edit> Stewart appears on Genesis\\'s first two singles, \"The Silent Sun\" / \"That\\'s Me\" and \"A Winter\\'s Tale\" / \"One-Eyed Hound\".   </edit>\\nThe book received favourable reviews and was nominated for the prestigious Miles Franklin Award.\\nStewart\\'s second book, The Catcher in the Rye, was published in 1951 and became an instant best-seller.\\nThe book has been translated into more than 30 languages and has sold over 150 million copies worldwide.\\nIt is considered one of the most influential books of the 20th century and has been read by generations of teenagers around the world.\\nStewart\\'s follow-up book, The Outsiders, also became a best-seller and was nominated for the Man Booker Prize.\\nStewart\\'s other books include The Daytrippers (a novel about'"

The owlets, spotted near their burrow in northern Israel, fluffed each others feathers in an affectionate display. They were captured by Israeli native Vladimir Kogan, who spent weeks waiting for the perfect shot of the young owls. Peck on the cheek: These two cute owls showed some affection ahead of Valentine's Day . Nibble, nibble: The owlets could be seen lovingly pecking at each other on a branch near their nest . That's the spot: One of the owlets looks like he is about to float away as the other 'kisses' him on the cheek . Mr Kogan, 44, has told of how he waited patiently in the hot sun for the young owls to emerge from their burrows in a remote part of Beit She'an, Israel. After a few weeks, the owlets became used to his presence, and were soon so unafraid of him that they allowed him to come close enough to take these images. Mr Kogan said: 'There were seven fledglings all together but these two seemed never seemed to leave each other's side. 'After spending weeks watching the birds you really get to know each of their personalities, these two were especially affectionate. Magic moments: The adorable pictures were captured by Israeli photographer\\xa0Vladimir Kogan . Result: Mr Kogan had to be patient and wait until the young owls were unafraid of him before snapping away . He's a hoot! The two love birds spent nearly ten minutes pecking away at each other's feathers . Owl always love you: The young owls were spotted cuddling near Beit She'an, Israel . 'It took me a couple of days to organise a good place to shoot from, then I tried placing a tree branch where I thought they might land. 'Luckily, I was rewarded with some great shots. 'The young owls got used to my hide and simply went about their business towards the end. 'This was a great feeling and it meant I could photograph them freely from a distance of only ten metres. 'I grew attached to the little owls but it wasn't long before the time came for them to leave their nest.'\", 'highlights': \"The two love birds were spotted cuddling near\\xa0Beit She'an, Israel .

The pair were seen picking each other\\'s feathers and pecking, showing just how strong their bond truly is. The owls in question are a rare species of bird, and are notoriously difficult to spot in the wild. However, one talented photographer spent weeks carefully luring the birds out of their nest, and was finally rewarded with this beautiful display of love. The photographer, who wishes to remain anonymous, explained that he spent countless hours tracking the movements of the owls, studying their habits and patterns until he was able to predict where they would be at any given time. \"It was a lot of hard work and dedication, but seeing these majestic creatures in their natural habitat was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\" he said. The owls themselves were spotted near a small stream in the Beit She\\'an area, where they were seen snuggled up together, clearly enjoying each other\\'s company. Despite their elusive nature, these owls have become something of a local celebrity in the area, with many people making the journey to see them in action. Some have even begun leaving small tokens of appreciation near their nest, such as food and other treats. However, despite the adoration they receive from the public, these birds remain fiercely independent, and are known to be quite territorial. So, while it may be tempting to get too close to them, experts warn that doing so could be dangerous. Overall, the sighting of these owls is a heartening reminder of the beauty that can be found in nature, and of the importance of preserving these creatures and their habitats for future generations to enjoy. So, if you happen to be in the Beit She\\'an area, keep your eyes peeled for these two love birds, and take a moment to appreciate the wonder of the natural world.'}\n"

      "{'human_text': \"Pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the plans . Secondary schools would be required to teach pupils in sets according to ability under plans being considered by the Tories. They would be penalised for teaching mixed-ability groups for key subjects under controversial proposals to make sets effectively compulsory. The idea is being considered for inclusion in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto. It would build on the policy blueprint in 2010, which pledged to ‘encourage setting so those who are struggling get extra help and the most able are stretched’. One report claimed Downing Street was pushing for the policy to be announced sooner and had even booked a venue for a launch. But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted in the Commons there was ‘absolutely no truth’ in the ‘rumours’. She said political opponents had a ‘rather unhealthy interest sometimes in speculating about what I am or am not about to announce’. In an interview she added: 'It’s not something I am looking at.' Both Labour and the Tories have long supported setting but stopped short of making it compulsory. However last year the head of Ofsted called for greater use of sets from age 11 to ensure the brightest pupils reach their potential. Figures suggest the practice of separating children into ability groups does not become widespread until children are 14. Even among older children, not all schools use ability groups in core subjects. Ofsted’s Sir Michael Wilshaw said: 'I’d set from the word go (in secondary schools). 'Too many non-selective schools are failing to nurture scholastic excellence.’ Sources said the idea was ‘under discussion’ and part of the ‘policy debate at the moment’. While in opposition David Cameron called for a ‘grammar stream’ in every subject in all comprehensives. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (left) denied claims the plans would be included in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto. David Cameron (right) called for a 'grammar stream' in every subject in all comprehensives . He said: ‘I want to see setting in every single school. Parents know it works. Teachers know it works.’ It was claimed yesterday Mr Cameron’s advisers had drawn up plans for a compulsory setting policy. A source close to David Laws, the Lib Dem schools minister, said: ‘This has not been agreed with the Liberal Democrats and is not government policy. 'We don’t believe it would be appropriate to tie schools’ hands in this way.’ And Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘This is an area for teachers to decide and for results to speak for themselves.’ Research published two years ago by the Royal Economic Society showed a higher proportion of ‘low-achieving pupils’ in each class had a ‘negative and significant effect on the academic achievements of regular pupils’ because they monopolised teachers’ attention. The announcement of the plans comes as teachers have been told to consider using seating plans to split up troublemakers and stop pupils choosing to sit with friends.\", 'highlights': \"Plans may be included in 2015 Conservative Party manifesto, sources say . All key\\xa0subjects in secondary schools would be grouped by pupils' ability . David Cameron called for a 'grammar stream' in 'every single school' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan denied claims plans would be included .\", 'id': 'ede9a56dd437e81c5a99f66fa3d29336b4fd50c1', 'machine_text': 'The Conservative Party is reportedly considering the inclusion of plans to group all key subjects in secondary schools by pupils\\' ability in its manifesto for the upcoming 2015 election. Sources within the party have revealed that the plans, which would entail the formation of a \\'grammar stream\\' in every school, have been discussed at the highest levels. Party leader and Prime Minister David Cameron has been a proponent of such a scheme for some time, arguing that it would provide greater opportunities for academically gifted students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In a speech in 2014, Cameron stated that \"we should have a \\'grammar stream\\' in every single school, so that we can stretch our brightest children to the utmost\". The proposed plans would see pupils divided into groups based on their academic ability, with those deemed to be the most capable placed in a \\'grammar stream\\' focused on more challenging coursework. Proponents of the scheme argue that it would enable brighter students to advance at a faster pace, while also freeing up teachers to devote more attention to pupils who are struggling. However, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has denied that the plans will be included in the party\\'s manifesto. Speaking in an interview for BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Morgan stated that \"we have no plans at this stage to introduce any kind of grammar stream or grammar schools\". The proposal has garnered mixed reactions from educational experts and policymakers. Supporters argue that it would allow schools to tailor their teaching methods to individual needs, while also promoting healthy competition among pupils. However, critics have expressed concerns that the scheme could further entrench socioeconomic divides, with disadvantaged pupils potentially being left behind. The prospect of a grammar stream in every school has also raised questions over the future of grammar schools themselves. Currently, grammar schools are only present in a select number of areas in England, and are widely considered to be a controversial form of education due to their selective admissions process. Opponents of grammar schools argue that they unfairly advantage wealthier families who can afford to pay for additional tutoring to prepare for the demanding entrance exams. Supporters, however, argue that they provide a vital form of high-quality education for academically gifted students who may struggle in comprehensive schools. It is unclear whether the Conservative Party will ultimately include plans for a \\'grammar stream\\' in its manifesto for the 2015 election. However, the proposal has reignited a longstanding debate over the merits and drawbacks of selective education, and the best way to provide educational opportunities for all students, regardless of their backgrounds or abilities.'}\n"

She created leading roles in some of the most notable French opéras comiques of the first half of the nineteenth century, including \"Fra Diavolo\" by Daniel Auber and \"Le postillon de Lonjumeau\" by Adolphe Adam. Career\\nGeneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost, also known as Zoé Prévost, had a younger brother, Eugene, who was a composer and conductor. Zoé studied singing at the Paris Conservatoire and made her debut at the Opéra-Comique, Paris, in 1821. The Opéra-Comique at that time presented operas light in tone and with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers. She created leading roles in many opéras comiques including  the title role in \"La marquise de Brinvilliers\", a collaborative work between nine composers, and in works by Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, and others. Considered one of the major stars of the lyric stage of her day, Prévost was esteemed for her  unaffected stage presence, her charm of person and manner, her skills as a comic actress, and her excellent singing technique. She created the leading soprano roles in two opéras comiques still performed today, Zerlina in \"Fra Diavolo\" by Auber in 1830 and Madeleine in \"Le postillon de Lonjumeau\" by Adam in 1836, the most successful works of those two composers. In the latter work, as in others, she appeared opposite her husband, leading tenor Jean-Baptiste Chollet, by whom she had one daughter, Caroline, who also achieved success as a singer under the stage name Mademoiselle Monrose. Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost also appeared in other French and Belgian opera houses.',\n '200 word wikipedia style introduction on \\'Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost\\'\\n    Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost (15 April 1802, Paris – 12 September 1863, Paris) was a French artist and writer.\\n\\nGeneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost was born on 15 April 1802 in Paris.
